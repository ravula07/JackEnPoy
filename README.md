# JackEnPoy
This repository contains an implementation of the popular game "Jackenpoy" (also known as "Rock, Paper, Scissors") written in the Jack programming language. The game is part of the nand2tetris project, which focuses on building a computer system from scratch.

**Jackenpoy** is a two-player game where each player simultaneously chooses one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The choices are then compared, and the winner is determined based on the following rules:

                  Rock beats scissors
                  Paper beats rock
                  Scissors beat paper
    
The game continues until a player reaches a specified number of wins.

## Features
